It's a pit clock

Just open the index.html file in chrome or smth and enjoy

To start a match, you have to run `init("event", teamnumber)` in the console

It's real time, so if the event is over, it'll break. However, you can add matches and manipulate time if you feel like it.
I kinda forget what the methods are to do that, I'll put em here when I figure it out.
