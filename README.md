# pit-clock
It's a pit clock

Just open the index.html file in chrome or smth and enjoy

To start a match, you have to run `init("eventKey", teamnumber)` in the console

To add a match, use `addMatch(["red1", "red2", "red3", "blue1", "blue2", "blue3"], new Date(matchTime), "matchLevel")

It's real time, so if the event is over, it'll break. However, you can add matches and manipulate time if you feel like it.
